        "II. INFORMATION WE PROCESS\n" +
        "There are two general categories of information we can process.\n" +
        "II.1 Information that you submit\n" +
        "We process the following personal information about you when you use the App. This information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us. Without such information, it is impossible to provide complete functionality of the App and perform the requested services.\n" +
        "Other Information directly related to your use of the App, such as photos and documents you upload to the App. Upon your consent, we also may have access to your camera roll.\n" +
        "II.2 Information That Is Processed Automatically\n" +
        "When you use the App, some information about your device and your user behavior may be processed automatically. This information is generally non-personal, i.e. it does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual, and we may access it only in aggregated form. We process this information on the ground of our legitimate interest in improving our App and giving our users the best experience. If we do not access such data, we may not be able to provide you with all the requested services and features of the App.\n" +
        "We use third-party automatic data processing technologies to analyze certain information sent by your device or our App. Automatic data processing technologies (advertising or analytics tools) provide us with the data described below. We do not control, supervise or respond for how the third parties process your personal data, that might be collected by their own means (not through our App). Due to the fact that some of our third parties declare themselves controllers for the purposes of the GDPR, any information request regarding your personal data should be directed to such third parties.\n" +
        "Log file information. Log file information is automatically reported each time you make a request to access the App. It can also be provided when the App is installed on your device. When you use our App, analytics tools automatically record certain log file information, including time and date when you start and stop using the App, and how you interact with the App. The App may use automated processing of your personal data, including profiling, which means any form of automated processing of personal data used to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to you, in particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning your personal preferences, interests, behavior, location or movements. Processing information through automatic data processing technologies starts automatically when you start using the App.\n" +
        "Cookies and similar technologies. When you use the App, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, scripts to process information about how you use our App and provide features to you. A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information, which is downloaded to your device when you access the App. The text file is then sent back to our server each time you use the App. This enables us to operate the App more effectively. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how our App is used, improve our marketing efforts, and provide content and features that are of interest to you. We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to the App, which may use cookies or similar technologies.\n" +

        "Our mission is to constantly improve our App and provide you with new experiences. As part of this mission, we use your information for the following purposes:\n" +
        "(a) To make our service available. We use information that you submit and information that is processed automatically to provide you with all requested services.\n" +
        "(b) To improve, test and monitor the effectiveness of our App. We use information that is processed automatically to better understand user behavior and trends, detect potential outages and technical issues, to operate, protect, improve, and optimize our App.\n" +
        "(c) To provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content. We may use information that is processed automatically for marketing purposes (to show ads that may be of interest to you based on your preferences). We provide personalized content and information to you, which can include online ads or other forms of marketing.\n" +
        "(d) To communicate with you. We use the information we have to communicate with you through newsletters, i.e. to send you marketing notifications, receive your feedback about our App experience, and let you know about our policies and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.\n" +
        "(e) To prevent fraud and spam, to enforce the law. We really want our App to be free of spam and fraudulent content so that you feel safe and free. We may use your information to prevent, detect, and investigate fraud, security breaches, potentially prohibited or illegal activities, protect our trademarks and enforce our Terms of Use.\n" +

        "IV. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION\n" +
        "We will not rent or sell your personal data to any third parties, but we may share your information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that provide automatic data processing technologies for the App. We do not control or influence these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used.\n" +
        "We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This information allows third-party ad networks, inter alia, to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.\n" +
        "We may engage the following third parties in order to provide us with necessary infrastructure for delivery and improvement of our services.\n" +

        "V. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS\n" +
        "We work in the cross-border area and provide our App to our Users around the world.\n" +
        "We and third-party organizations that provide automatic data processing technologies for the App or our third-party advertising partners may transfer the automatically processed information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.\n" +
        "If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data processing that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as in your jurisdiction.\n" +
        "This means that your personal information can be transferred to a third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or to the international organization where data protection and confidentiality regulations may not provide the same level of protection of personal data as your country does.\n" +
        "We try to make sure that the recipient of any personal data provides a proper protection of the personal data received, in accordance with the current legislation on the protection of such information.

If you no longer want us to use your information that we physically access and store, you can request that we erase your personal information and close your account.\n" +
        "However, some data may still be stored for a certain time period (but no longer than the storage purpose requires) if information is necessary to comply with legal obligation (taxation, accounting, audit) or in order to maintain safety and data backup settings, prevent fraud or other malicious acts.\n" +

        "VII. EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS\n" +
        "For the personal data we store and access, you are entitled to address us regarding the following issues:\n" +
        "Data Access and Portability. You can request copies of your personal information held by us.\n" +
        "Change or Correct Data. Where you cannot update data by yourself through your account, you have the right to ask us to correct change, update or rectify your data.\n" +
        "Data Retention and Deletion.
